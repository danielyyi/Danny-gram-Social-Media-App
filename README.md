# Danny-gram-Social-Media-App

Here's the link to the website: https://danny-gram.netlify.app/
Note: It mag take a while for the posts to show up due to the server having to start up. After that, everything should be pretty quick. 

This is a simple social media website with CRUD functionality, responsive web design, and the implementation of the MERN stack web development method. I created this website by following a tutorial by JSMastery on Youtube, and it helped give me a better understanding of how to connect the backend to the frontend in web development. The app is very simple as it does not feature user authentication, pagination, etc. however I do plan on making a social media app with those features once I am more confident in my MERN stack abilites.
